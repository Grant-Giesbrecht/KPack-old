This document describes the defining factors to the .KV1 Version 1 file specification.

Data types:
	- KV1 files can store 4 data types universal to K-Programs.
		- KMatrix
		- Double
		- String
		- Bool
	- Integers are not supported because doubles can represent the same data.

Comments:
	- Comments are supported; any characters following a double slash (//) is considered a comment.

Descriptors:
	- Each variable can have a description assigned to it.
	- A description is a string associated with the variable. The purpose is to allow user descriptions of variables to be saved.
	- A description is a comment following a variable declaration (same line).

Headers:
	- A header is a special type of comment (multiple lines permitted).
	- Only one header is allowed per file.
	- A header is created by encompassing lines containing text with the macro "HEADER".
	- Headers are intended to be used as a description of the file and its contents.

Macros:
	- Macros are keywords in a KV1 file used to specify special sections in the file.
	- A macro is always written in all caps and follows the pound sign (#).
		- VERSION: Must be followed by a space and then a decimal number specifying the version of the KV1 specification used in the file. 
				This macro is required in all KV1 files. 
				This macro may only appear once in a KV1 file.
				This macro must always be the first line in the file.
		- HEADER: Encompasses lines of text that define the file's header.
				This macro may only appear twice in a KV1 file (to surround text).

Variable Syntax:
	-The syntax for declaring a variable is like so:
		1.) The first word must be the datatype. Options include:
			- double
			- string
			- matrix
			- bool
		2.) The second word must be the variable's name. The C programming language variable naming requirements apply here.
		3.) The third word must be an equals sign (=).
		4.) The fourth word is the value (sometimes this is more than one word).
			- Doubles require a number (decimals, negatives, and scientific notation allowed).
			- Strings require a string encased in double quotes.
			- Bools require a boolean value signified with 'True' or 'False'.
			- Matricies require a matrix surrounded by square brackets, formatted with commas between values sharing a row, and semicolons deliniating between rows.
				A matrix may be broken into multiple lines in the KV1 file. Tabs and spaces will be ignored so it can be formatted for easy manual reading.
		5.) The final character must be a semicolon.
	e.g. double double_var = 4.556;
	e.g. string string_var = "Hello world\nI am a second line.";
	e.g. bool bool_var = True;
	e.g. matrix matrix_var = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
	e.g. matrix matrix_var2 = [1, 2, 3;
							   4, 5, 6;
							   7, 8, 9];
